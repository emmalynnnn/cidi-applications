# Emma's CIDI & Accessibility Applications
Center for Instructional Design and Innovation - Utah State University
* Created by Emma Lynn (e.lynn@usu.edu)
* Supervised by Neal Legler, CIDI Director (neal.legler@usu.edu) & Christopher Phillips, Electronic & Information Technology Accessibility Coordinator (christopher.phillips@usu.edu)

This is a simple static website that makes the web applications and documentation I've written available in one place.
This is a more client oriented version of the more developer oriented documentation I've written [here](https://github.com/emmalynnnn/cidi-docs).
